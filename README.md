# COVID-19-tracking

A web app for searching information about the coronavirus in different countries (or within provinces/cities if exists).

## Getting Started

This app is created with Vanilla JS and JQuery, and Ajax is used to retrieve information from an API. Therefore, you will need to install JQuery. Also, I am using AOS.js and Lax.js for this project.

### Built With

* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - Framework
* [AJAX](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/) - JQuery function
* [AOS.js](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) - Used for animations
* [Lax.js](https://alexfox.dev/lax.js/) - Used for scroll effects

### Installation

To run this app, you need to install following packages:

JQuery

```
npm install jquery
```

AOS.js

```
npm install aos
```

Lax.js

```
npm install lax.js
```

All icons used in the project are from font-awesome

```
npm install font-awesome
```

For the structure, I am using Webpack

```
npm install webpack
```
